				<h2>Biome</h2>
				<p>Biome is a prototype 3D-roguelike made in C# with Unity, done as a school project over a semester. I worked on the procedural terrain and objects generation. On this page you will find some details on this part.</p>
				<p>You can check the <a href="https://gitlab.com/Atchoom/biome">source code</a>.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>You can take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRjrrGLzHUc">presentation video</a> realised at the end of the project.</p>
				<p>The objectives were to dispose of a tool that would enable game designers to design maps for the game Biome. We decided to keep it as configurable as we could. However, some decisions were made and fixed. We wanted the world to be composed of several ring shaped regions called biomes.</p>
				The objectives were :
				<ul>
					<li>have a big map</li>
					<li>have configurable biome numbers</li>
					<li>have configurable relief for each biome</li>
					<li>enable dynamic relief modification</li>
					<li>lessen the impact of the generation on the framerate</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Coordinates system</h2>
				<p>Since the world was going to be circular, I thought it would be interesting to use a hexagonal shaped grid instead of a traditional square grid, in order to smooth the generation. Lots of thanks to <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">Amit Patel</a> and his <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">Hexagonal grid reference</a> which made this a lot easier.</p>

					<div class="first">
						<p>We then decided to cut the terrain in tiles. Those tiles would have configurable sizes, both concerning the hexagons size and the tile radius, as you can see in the figure. This makes it possible to change those parameters to generate a smaller or bigger map with different costs.</p>
						<p>During the development, when facing a bug we often tried several tile radii in order to identify it, but we usually sticked at the value 17, except one of us who had difficulties running it on his computer, and used a smaller value.</p>
						<p>You might see it on the figure, the hexagons are not exactly regular. In order to ease some computations, I made them a bit higher. Thinking about it some time later, I reckon this might have cause some problems we faced during the development.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="second">
						<p>We then assembled those tiles in order to create the terrain, which is generated in the following order :</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The center tile (on which the player begins)</li>
							<li>All tiles of the first ring of tiles, turning counter-clockwise</li>
							<li>Then the next ring, until a target ring is reached</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The number of rings generated is configurable.</p>
