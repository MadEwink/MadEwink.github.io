description=Law Enforcer is a plateformer in which the player has three abilities : jump, dash and attack. The player can also set world rules which prevent both themselves and the world boss to use those abilities. It was developped from scratch in C++ with the <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d">Box2D</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zeux/pugixml">PugiXML</a> libraries.
